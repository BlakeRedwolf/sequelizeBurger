# HW Week 15 - {sequelizeBurger}
"sequelizeBurger" is the my Burger application Sequelized. In this application, i will replace the MySQL Burger Model with a Sequelize equivalent.

## Live Link

## Description on how to use the app
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

## Requirements
#### Add a simple description of what the HW requirements were

- In this assignment, you're going to Sequelize the Burger app you made last week.
- Remove all references to your vanilla MySQL queries and replace them with Sequelize queries.
That means:
- Replacing your MySQL Burger model with a Sequelized equivalent.
- Don't forget to edit the model and initial migration file to make the burger's devoured field carry a default value of false -- otherwise you might encounter bugs.
- There's no option to include that default in the command line, so you'll need to open up Sublime to make this change.
- Don't forget to sync the models!
- Edit your new config.json file to include your database configurations. Place your JawsDB details in the  production property of your json file; the details of your local database go in the developer property.
- Remove your old ORM file, as well as any references to it in burgers_controller.js. Replace those references with Sequelize's ORM methods.
